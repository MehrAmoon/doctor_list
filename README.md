# MVVM architecure
I chose MVVM because:
MVVM separates your view (i.e. Activities and Fragments) from your business logic. MVVM is enough for small projects, but when your codebase becomes huge, your ViewModels start bloating. Separating responsibilities becomes hard.


# Dagger2 DI
There are several benefits from using dependency injection containers rather than having components satisfy their own dependencies. Some of these benefits are:
Reduced Dependencies
Reduced Dependency Carrying
More Reusable Code
More Testable Code
More Readable Code

# lottie and TheKhaeng
I decided to use these libraries for my animations,
Lottie is a mobile library for Android and iOS that parses Adobe After Effects animations exported as json with Bodymovin and renders them natively on mobile!
TheKhaeng is a library for Android developers who want to create "push down animation click" for view like spotify application.
